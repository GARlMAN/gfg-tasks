# gfg Mandatory Task 
in this i wrote a code which converts string into star pattern 

# overview 
in this when u run all 3 codes it shows three option 
the first one is Next-line
i.e
h\
e\
l\
l\
o\
\
w\
o\
r\
l\
d\

the second one in the same line
i.e is star format
h e l l o  w o r l d

# functin one prits line by line
it's farily easy to achieve that u just have to create su functions of all letters and it will print itself 



# function two prints in the same line
this one is a bit buggy right now cuz my code has problems doin the some lettes twice and it's limited to 76 characters because of the python limit i can improve it's a bit hard to fix it and i don't have enough time to fix the small bugs i have

i put it here anyways i wanted to show my progress

so that's all the summry u need to know what my code does
