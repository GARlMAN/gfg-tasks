# GFG_ML
so this is my ml project that i worked on for my application of gfg
my projects has 3 parts for now and it may contain a 4th part

## data visualisation
which is basically the stuff i used to select which features i want to extract and which features do actually matter 

## Random forest which i fine tuned to give about 92% accuracy on the test set
this was my second attempt in which i used a Random forest to get my model it started off at 85% but with a bit of fine tunning i got it upto 92% which i'm quite pround off


## SVR model which i fine tuned to give 70% accuracy on the test set
this was my first attempt at making a model which didn't turn out the way i wanted it to but i still ended up getting the model upto 70% accuracy with alot of fine tuning


all my models are done using sklearn and python
